## This repository contains a deep learning project focused on regression tasks using the Keras API with TensorFlow as its backend. The aim of this project is to build, train, and evaluate neural network models to predict continuous target variables based on input features.

Key features of this project include:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

- Building various Keras sequential and/or functional API models.

- Model training and validation

- Evaluation of regression models using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RÂ²).

- Visualization of model performance and predictions.


## I am using data from a Kaggle data set: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
### This dataset contains comprehensive information about house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, Washington, USA. It covers homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset is rich with various features that influence house prices, making it an excellent candidate for developing a robust regression model.
### Size: Approximately 21,613 observations.

### Features: The dataset includes 21 variables providing details about each house. Key features encompass:

- date: Date house was sold.

- bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.

- bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.

- sqft_living: Square footage of the living space.

- sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot.

- floors: Number of floors.

- waterfront: Whether the house has a waterfront view (binary).

- view: Number of times the house has been viewed.

- condition: Condition of the house (ordinal scale).

- grade: Grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system.

- sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from basement.

- sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.

- yr_built: Year the house was built.

- yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated.

- zipcode: Zipcode area.

- lat, long: Latitude and longitude coordinates.

- sqft_living15: Average square footage of the living room of 15 nearest neighbors.

- sqft_lot15: Average square footage of the lot of 15 nearest neighbors.

- Target Variable: The primary target for prediction in this project is price, representing the sale price of the house.
